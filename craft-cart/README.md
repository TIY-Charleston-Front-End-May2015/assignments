### Normal Mode

  Congratulations!  You've recently come into some time to bootstrap your (our) new idea.  We're going to build a Crafty eCommerce Solution that sources artisans from around the globe and sells their wares.  Like many startups with good ideas, we have no data - so we need to integrate Etsy's api for products.

  - Crafty Cart needs to have 3 Views
    - A Product listing View
      - Each product will have the following in listing
        - a buy/add to cart button
        - photo
        - title
        - link back to etsy product (view on etsy)
      - The listing page will need filtering functionality for the following attributes
        - title
        - price
    - Product Detail View
      - Detail view will only have user selected product
        - all the above data is required, but additionally
        - show Description
        - show materials used
        - use larger image
    - A shopping cart view
      - This view will house the items that have been added to cart.
      - you can design how you want, but you will need to have a running total of items in cart, in addition to quantity and title of product.
      - users should be able to remove items from cart
